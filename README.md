Your self-hosted, Calibre-powered reading sanctuary. Read your ebooks anywhere, on any device, fully offline.

Foxtales decouples your ebook library from a single machine, giving you and your family a private, reader-friendly web app that syncs your progress across all your devices: Desktops, Smartphones, Tablets and Ebook Readers.

The development is focused on these features:

* Offline support: Read your most loved books in the deepest desert.
* Ebook-Reader friendly
* Mobile friendly
* Installable Web-App
* Easy to self-host
* Sync of reading progress across devices
* Avoid vendor lock-in by managing the whole library in Calibre-compatible format
* Support of multiple users (Not there yet, sorry, it's only for you atm üíù)

## Installation

Just copy the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) to your machine or server, modify the variables so that it
suits your needs and run it using `docker compose up`

‚ö†Ô∏è I do not have to tell you that the password "password" is a bad idea, so please change it ;-)

## Supported file formats

* PDF
* EPUB
* CBZ
* MOBI
* KF8 (AZW3)
* FB2

## Technical stuff

The frontend is written in VueJS, using foliate-js to display the ebooks.

The backend is written in Python, using FastAPI and calibredb to communicate with the shipped Calibre instance.
